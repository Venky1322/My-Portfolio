                    <p>A landing page is a standalone web page designed to focus on a specific goal, such as promoting a product, service, event, or campaign. Unlike other pages on a website (like homepages), landing pages are intentionally created with a single purpose and minimal distractions, often targeting a specific audience. A landing page typically includes:

                        HTML: The main structure of your webpage. CSS: Styling to make your page visually appealing. JavaScript (optional): For adding interactivity. Assets: Images, fonts, and other media files. Organize these files in a project folder. </p>
